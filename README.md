## Analysis
The analysis reveals that among the incidents occurring in Chicago from 2001 to 2022, theft was the most frequent, totaling 469,350 occurrences, followed by battery with 41,555 occurrences and criminal damage with 256,948 occurrences. The least common crimes in Chicago were non-criminal incidents and ritualism.

In our analysis within the notebook, we examined the crime trend, revealing a notable decrease from 2001 to 2015, followed by a minor increase in 2016, and then a persistent decline until 2022. Among all the criminal incidents recorded in Chicago during this timeframe, arrests were made in 73.4% of cases, leaving 26.6% without any arrests.
The study conducted on crime incidents categorized by seasons in Chicago.
The data visualization indicates that the highest number of incidents occurred during the summer, with 615,757 recorded. In spring, there were 572,478 incidents, followed by 556,263 in autumn, while winter had the fewest occurrences of 496,873 crimes.

We examined the top 10 locations with the highest number of crime incidents. The most frequent location in Chicago was the street, with 583,480 incidents, followed by residences and apartments with 376,440 and 249,581 incidents, respectively. The least frequent among the top 10 locations was the residence-garage, with 39,648 incidents.

Chicago comprises of 77 communities, and based on our analysis, Austin reported the highest number of crime incidents, totaling 141,925, followed by Near North Side and South Shore with 78,979 and 74,855 incidents, respectively. These findings suggest that these communities may be among the least safe places to reside. Conversely, the communities with the lowest incidence of criminal activities include Edison Park, Burnside, Forest Glen, Hegewisch, and Mount Greenwood, which can be regarded as the safest communities in Chicago.

We conducted an examination of criminal activities across various days of the week. Our analysis indicated that while there isn't a significant difference among the number of crimes, Fridays accounted for the highest frequency of incidents, while Sundays was the least. 
Additionally, we explored the types of crimes occurring in 2022, observing that theft remained the most prevalent, consistent with the findings from our analysis of the entire dataset. However, noted that public indecency emerged as the least occurring crime in 2022, which is different from the overall analysis of the dataset.


## Recommendations
1. It is advisable to prioritize street surveillance, considering that a significant portion of criminal activities occur in these areas.

2. Given the notable incidence of crimes in proximity to the airport, it is imperative to develop and implement effective strategies to mitigate these occurrences, safeguarding the well-being of travellers.

3. Chicago has experienced a substantial decline in crime rates over recent years. It is prudent to reinforce and further invest in the existing strategies that have contributed to this positive trend.

4. Recognizing exemplary performance among security personnel through commendations can serve as a catalyst for heightened motivation and continued success in crime prevention efforts.
