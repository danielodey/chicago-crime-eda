## Introduction
Crime is a socio-economic problem that is a major concern for most countries. Beyond the direct harm that could be caused by a crime, research has shown that there are emotional and physical effects it has on an indivdual. This project focuses on the crimes that happened in the city of Chicago from 2001 to 2022.
An exploratory data analysis is carried out using the chicago dataset to understand patterns, answer specific questions and help us make informed decisions.
